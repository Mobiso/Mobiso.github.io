      <description>Currently, I am taking a course in applied cryptography and a project course on building a secure network. I will update my website once I have written my reports and documentation.&#xA;For the applied cryptography course, I have coded an implementation of AES in Rust and completed Set 1 of the Cryptopals challenges.&#xA;I will also probably add some writeups for some picoCTF forensic flags once I have time.</description>

      <title>Bachelor Degree Project: Password Generation using ambient sound</title>

      <description>My bachelor degree project that investigates if using regular ambient sound can be used to generate secure passwords.&#xA;In short: it is not great. Using two computers to record audio simultaneously resulted in one computer showing terrible entropy according to the NIST 800-90B test suite, while the other showed great entropy. When using the recorded audio as an entropy source for our underlying hash-based RNG, our RNG passed the NIST 800-22 tests.</description>
