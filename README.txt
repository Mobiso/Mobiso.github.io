A modfified Dimension Template by HTML5 UP which was free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)

I use it to display my portfolio :) 
I also barely know any HTML or CSS so editing it has been pretty difficult.
Thanks chatgpt, w3school and all youtubers!
