Currently, I am taking a course in applied cryptography and a project course on building a secure network. I will update my website once I have written my reports and documentation.

For the applied cryptography course, I have coded an implementation of AES in Rust and completed Set 1 of the Cryptopals challenges.

I will also probably add some writeups for some picoCTF forensic flags once I have time.
