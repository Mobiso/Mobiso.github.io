I am currently a student at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden, working on my masters in Cybersecurity. Prior to my university studies, I worked at 'Pålgård Söner och Kran AB' where I briefly started part time as IT support in their small office right after high school. From my high school studies I obtained a vocational degree as an IT technician.

After a short period, I was given the opportunity to broaden my role and joined the company as a crane operator fulltime. Later, I was entrusted with additional responsibilities as a weighbridge operator. Although I enjoyed the new challenges, I realized my passion for IT was still strong. This led me to continue working part-time while pursuing my studies at KTH, where I am now studying to become an engineer.

My colleagues have described me as reliable and friendly, with my proudest moment being when I was described as 'the only part-timer who never had any issues.'
