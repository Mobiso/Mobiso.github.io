							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<p>I am currently a student at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden, working on my bachelor’s project. 
									Prior to my university studies, I worked at 'Pålgård Söner och Kran AB' where I briefly started part time as IT support in their small office right after high school. 
									From my high school studies I obtained a vocational degree as an IT technician.</p>

								<p>After a short period, I was given the opportunity to broaden my role and joined the company as a crane operator fulltime.
									Later, I was entrusted with additional responsibilities as a weighbridge operator. 
	 								Although I enjoyed the new challenges, I realized my passion for IT was still strong. 
	 								This led me to continue working part-time while pursuing my studies at KTH, where I am now studying to become an engineer.</p>

								<p>My colleagues have described me as reliable and friendly, with my proudest moment being when I was described as 'the only part-timer who never had any issues.'</p>
